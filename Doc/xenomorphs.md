# A Design document indicating various xenomorph parameters
## Factions:
- xenomorph: regular, hive-loyal xenomorphs.

## Species:
- XENOMORPH_TINY: for xenomorphs with an extremely small size. (Larvae)
- XENOMORPH: for most average Tier 1 and Tier 2 xenomorphs. Human sized. (Runners, Lurkers...)
- XENOMORPH_BIG: for most tier 3 xenomorphs. Big size. (Praetorians, Crushers, Boilers...)
- XENOMORPH_BIG_FIREIMMUNE: big xenomorphs that are fire immune. (Queen, Ravager)

## Tiers:
Tiers are, in a sense, how many times the xenomorph caste has evolved past a larva with the exception of the queen, who does not evolve and is not evolved into. Generally, the higher the tier, the stronger the xenomorph.
- Tier 0: Larva, Facehugger(?), Egg.
- Tier 1: Runner, Drone, Sentinel, Defender.
- Tier 2: Lurker, Warrior, Hivelord, Carrier, Burrower, Spitter
- Tier 3: Boiler, Praetorian, Ravager, Crusher.
- Tier 4: Queen.

## General information about xenomorphs:
Xenomorphs work on a hivemind. The only 'sentient' caste is the queen, and every other xenomorph is practically an extension of her will, and so although they are 'intelligent' enough to avoid obvious traps, they generally don't because they don't care about self-preservation except for the queen. As is commonly known by most USCM Personnel, xenomorphs have acidic blood, do not feel pain, and appear to be self-aware of the caustic capabilities of their blood, and so they may attempt to use it to inflict harm. They also do not need to breathe. The average xenomorph has limited sight, and usually relies on their subpar smelling and superior hearing to find victims. All Xenomorphs have a certain amount of health regeneration, Usually not enough to matter during combat.

Due to their exoskeleton, most xenomorphs possess better bash armor than they do other types of armor. The xenomorph's weak point is, as a rule of thumb, fire. A few castes have evolved to combat USCM pyrotechnicians, however...

Most xenomorphs attack on sight, however those of the worker caste may hesitate to engage armed and dangerous hosts.

## Information about specific castes:
