# General story/timeline of ACM:
## Year -3:
- A research drone sent from our dimension to another finds and brings back 'egg' samples from the rift. The eggs are kept inside containment to be experimented on later.

- The queen mother senses the energy from the rift, and thus notices the eggs being taken.

- The rift, in truth, had lead to Eridanus, LV-256, Summer's Stand, A long abandoned CLF outpost overtaken by xenomorphs.
## Year -1:
### Month 5:
  
- a Deepspace R&D Ship, the USS Aliston, Picks up high energy readings coming from the abandoned Eridanus sector and asks High Command for permission to investigate. HC approves. The USS Aliston departs for Eridanus.
### Month 8:
  
- The USS Aliston arrives to the area with the energy signatures. Many investigations later, they find nothing. After calling a meeting, it was decided that the Aliston would stay there for a couple more months to see if it happens again.
### Month 11:
  
- The energy signatures come back much stronger, and  the USS Aliston is, unfortunately, caught right in the middle. The energy storm rips the Aliston apart and sends it to our dimension, but not before it can activate its distress signal.

- The USS Providence, having recently exterminated the xenomorph threat in Cymopoleia, a nearby sector, are re-routed to investigate the distress signal unaware of the xenomorph larva that snuck onboard from their recent conflict.
## Year 0:
### Month 4:
  
- The larva that snuck onboard had evolved, captured and infected many crew members of the Providence. By the time they had noticed, the hive had grown to a considerable size and red alert was announced. The damage caused to the ship from the furious fighting that had ensued prevented them from knowing that the ship was right on top of an incoming energy rift. The USS Providence was destroyed and sent through the storm, but not before evacuation was called.

- Several escape pods were detected leaving the exploding ship and into the rift.

- The queen mother, having noticed that some of the pods were filled with xenomorphs and infected hosts, and wanting them to establish a new hive in this strange dimension, used a fraction of her psychic power to weaken the storm just enough so that the escape pods and their occupants would pass through unharmed.

- The remains of the ship and the pods, both empty and full, crash down into our world just as the american goverment falls. The marines, disoriented, step out of their escape pods and assess their situation. The xenomorphs spread out, looking to create a hive or ten in this new world.

- Game start.
