## Brief Description of USCM Jobs:
### Command: The leaders of the operation.
- Commanding Officer: Is the highest rank onboard the ship, and has the most authority. His will is absolute.
- Executive Officer: The commanding officer's second-in-command. Takes care of tasks not worth the CO's attention, and fills in for him if needed.
- Staff Officer(s): Are responsible for relaying information to squads. Act as the link between the CO/XO and the ground forces.

### Combat Support: Support the marines using firepower or otherwise.
- Intelligence Officer: Searches the area-of-operations for valuable intel and decodes it.
- Pilot Officer: Flies and maintains the ship's transport dropship and fighter planes.
- Vehicle Crewman: Operates and maintains the ship's groundside vehicles, from tanks to APCs to mobile artillery.

### Marines: The ground forces.
- Squad Leader: Highest rank amongst the squad. Relays info from command to his marines. 
- Squad Specialist: Uses and maintains heavy weaponry. Come in 5 variants:
  - Pyrotechnician: Uses an advanced flamethrower to provide area denial and clear xenomorph hives.
  - Demolitionist: Uses the M5 RPG to take care of problems, from light tanks to infantry squads.
  - Sniper: Provides long range fire support using the heavy-powered sniper at his disposal.
  - Scout: Uses a DMR and an experimental stealth cloak to infiltrate past enemy lines.
  - Grenadier: Uses a 6-round grenade launcher and near impenetrable armor to create openings for fellow marines.
- Squad Smartgunner: Uses and maintains the smartgun, a modern suppressive-fire machingun.
- Squad Medic: Is in charge of keeping (or attempting to keep) his squad in working condition.
- Squad Engineer: Uses engineering knowledge to build barricades, bridges, repair, destroy and everything inbetween. In charge of the squad's AI-controlled weaponry if present.
- Squad Marine: The rank and file grunt of the USCM. Shoots at the enemy, tries not to die.

### Engineering: The grease monkeys.
- Chief Engineer: Oversees engineering actions onboard the ship, delegates tasks to underlings. Is technically in charge of squad engineers but not really.
- Maintenance Technician: Preforms menial tasks onboard the ship, from repairs and cleaning to construction and destruction.
- Ordnance Technician: Uses knowledge, tools and viotile chemicals to create experimental explosives for marine use, ranging from grenades to rockets.

### Medical: The nerds.
- Chief Medical Officer: Oversees medical and research actions. Delegates tasks. Is technically in charge of squad medics but again, not really.
- Doctor: Takes care of injuries too severe for squad medics to handle on the field.
- Researcher: Researches things. Chemicals, medication, weaponry and everything else.

### Supply: The veins of the marine force.
- Requisitions Officer: Oversees cargo and requisitions actions.
- Cargo technician: Moves supplies, loads supplies, prepares supplies, breathes supplies.
- Chef: He's a chef. He cooks things.

### Non-Standard: Roles too specific to be put into other categories.
- Synthetic: A synthetic(Android) unit. Assists the crew to the best of its capabilities. Comes in two variants:
  - Combat Synthetic: Very rare and made in limited amounts due to pressure from the Sol goverment. An outstanding combat unit but is capable of little else.
  - Non-combat Synthetic: Possesses knowledge of practically everything, from engineering to medical. Its AI protocol forbids it from engaging in combat unless to defend itself or nearby USCM personnel.
