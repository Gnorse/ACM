# ACM: Aliens/Colonial Marines
A WIP Cataclysm: Dark days ahead mod that aims to add content from the Aliens universe and some of its offshoots, drawing inspiration from the Space Station 13 Colonial marines server as well as the other Alien games such as AVP Extinction. May delve into the Predator Universe a bit as work gets done.
